# DKG inside a SNARK PoC

This repo contains some sample code to generate proofs of correct VSS/DKG inside of a SNARK using BLS12-377 / BW6 curves.
You can find the associated blog post [here](https://hackmd.io/A6NbRWbqRMuu_l-Uf7xBjg?view).

**WARNING**: This code is very very experimental, not clean, and not audited. Do NOT use for anything in production.
